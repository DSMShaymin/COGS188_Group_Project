    "\n",
    "A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks and a prominent framework for approaching generative artificial intelligence.  In a GAN, two neural networks contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one agent's gain is another agent's loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. A typical use of a GAN is on images, where they are both used for training and generation to create photorealistic images that can trick humans into believing are real.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs introduced a novel adversarial training framework commonly used in data generation, such as images. A generator network G maps random noise to synthetic data while a discriminator D learns to distinguish real from fake samples. The networks optimize a minimax objective, with G minimizing and D maximizing the binary cross entropy loss. (Saxena & Cao, 2021). The architecture typically employs transposed convolutions in the generator for upsampling and standard convolutions in the discriminator, with DCGAN (Radford et al., 2015) being the most prominent examples of best-performing GANs for image generation.\n",

    "    - We will have a slides with similar artworks (Similar topics) one of the art will be an AI generated image and one will be a human generated image. We will then ask the class to determine which one is AI generated and show some possible give aways for why it is GAN generated. With this we will also show differences between different models to see if certain ones are easier to detect, and we will also have an AI vs AI portion to see if our classmates can determine which AI made a set of images. i.e. have 2 images from Dall-e, and 2 from midjourney. This should take about 5 minutes max to just show how developed GAN are. \n",
    "- \"Who Owns What Art?\" Game (Active Learning Activity #2)\n",
    "    - To go over the topic of ethics in GAN we will go through some situations where we will see who owns the art from generated images and from there we will go through some actual legislation that is happening to combat issues. To keep engagement we will have our classmates to determine who will own artwork and put them in certain situations which may have differing precedence. This activity shouldn't last longer than 5 minutes.\n",
